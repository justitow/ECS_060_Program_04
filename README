The testhw and the Testing directory are now available for use in ~ssdavis/60/p4.
Copy testhw to one of your own directories.
There is no need to copy the Testing directory.
testhw takes only one argument--the directory that holds your defragmenter.cpp source code.
testhw will copy from the Testing directory the MemRunner.*, mynew.*, MemCheck.o, MemCheck.h, and CPUTimer.h files.
It then compiles your program using your Makefile, and runs it with the three 
Mem-100-400000-*.txt files as its command line parameter.  
The results are placed in the results.txt file in the directory with the source code in it.
